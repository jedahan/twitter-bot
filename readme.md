# Twitter Bot with frontend example

## WARNING

  **YO YO LISTEN UP**

  Twitter does not recognize artificial intelligences and a legitimate use of its service. Things that will get you banned: 

  * only replying to people, never writing your own stuff
  * writing the same thing over and over, or very similar variants of stuff

  Your account will be banned, so make sure to use alt accounts.

  So I would recommend doing something interesting with the data, over making something that is chatty. Bots that do status updates are ok.
